I want to create a story generator for a BedTime History youtube  channel, my chnnale name is Whispers of History, which will generate stories of ancient history. The story will be generated from the story top in the prompts folder. it should pick the story topic which is not processed. it is tracked in the prompt_progress.txt file. total word count for the story is in the config file. based on the total word count, it should decide how many chapters will be needed for the story where each chapter is 1000 words. the llm should then be sent request to generate an outline for each chapter. it should be saved in a json file. after this, the llm should generate story chapterwise which is saved in a json file. for each chapter, we send the chapter outline json file as well as the entire previous chapters generated for context and continuation to produce a new chapter. each chapter should have 25 scenes with image prompt and narration text. this json file should also have video title. video description, thumbnail prompt. 
you need to ensure that the json file format is compatible wit the rest of the pipeline. 
you need to also ensure that the template prompt for the story generation is for ancient history. people are going to listen to when they are going to bed. it should be narrative and engaging. 

WE are going to replace the existing story generation already preosent in the codebase. give me a new plan and discuss with me. Ensure that it is compatible with the rest of the steps in the pipeline. for example, image generator with will take input from image_prompt field of the master json file.
